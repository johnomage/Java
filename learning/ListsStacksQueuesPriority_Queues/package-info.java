//Objectives
//■■ To explore the relationship between interfaces and classes in the Java
//Collections Framework hierarchy (§20.2).
//■■ To use the common methods defined in the Collection interface for
//operating collections (§20.2).
//■■ To use the Iterator interface to traverse the elements in a collection
//(§20.3).
//■■ To use a foreach loop to traverse the elements in a collection (§20.3).
//■■ To use a forEach method to perform an action on each element in a
//collection (§20.4).
//■■ To explore how and when to use ArrayList or LinkedList to store
//a list of elements (§20.5).
//■■ To compare elements using the Comparable interface and the
//Comparator interface (§20.6).
//■■ To use the static utility methods in the Collections class for sorting,
//searching, shuffling lists, and finding the largest and smallest element
//in collections (§20.7).
//■■ To develop a multiple bouncing balls application using ArrayList
//(§20.8).
//■■ To distinguish between Vector and ArrayList and to use the Stack
//class for creating stacks (§20.9).
//■■ To explore the relationships among Collection, Queue,
//LinkedList, and PriorityQueue and to create priority queues using
//the PriorityQueue class (§20.10).
//■■ To use stacks to write a program to evaluate expressions (§20.11).
